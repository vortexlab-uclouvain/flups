# Testing in FLUPS

Some of the tests performed in Flups use the Google Test framework, which organizes individual tests into a series of test suites and returns a xml reports which can be post processed by the Gitlab platform. 

## Test description 
Two types of test are implemented using the Google library: convergence tests and unit tests. 

### Convergence test 
Those tests verify the spatial convergence of the solver using all the available kernels with various combination of boundary conditions. For each test, we solve the Poisson equation 
<p align="center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\nabla^2 \phi = f, " title="Poisson equation" /></p>
 and the convergence of the solver is measured using the infinite norm of the error, defined as 
 <p align="center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?  E_\infty = \sup_{x,y,z} \{|\phi(x,y,z) - \phi_{ref}(x,y,z)|\} " title="Error inf" /></p>
where <p align="center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?  \phi_{ref}(x,y,z) = a(x)b(y)c(z) " title="Error inf" /></p> is an analytical solution composed as a product of 1D functions. Those functions, a, b, and c,  are defined depending on each set of boundary conditions. Given these analytical expression, the right and side f is computed as 
<p align="center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\nabla^2 f(x,y,z) = \frac{d^2}{dx^2}a(x)b(y)c(z) + a(x)\frac{d^2}{dy^2}b(y)c(z) + a(x)b(y)\frac{d^2}{dz^2}c(z), " title="Poisson equation" /></p>

The analytical solutions are detailed in the FLUPS paper. 

### Unit test 
We here check that the post-processing of the plan when using a node-centred layout is correct. For the moment, two tests have been implemented. 
The first one checks the DST and DCT. The boundary conditions are: ODD-ODD; EVEN-ODD; ODD-EVEN. In each direction, we fill the data which are not used by fftw and which are corrected by flups with spurious values. We then check that we retrieve the correct solution. 

The second one checks the DFTs. The test is basically the same than the first one, except that the boundary conditions are all periodic. 


## Implementation notes 
The heart of the tests is composed by two classes: the `AnalyticalField` and the `ConvergenceTest`. 

  1. The `AnalyticalField` stores the analytical expression for the RHS and the solution based on a set of boundary conditions. In other words, given the bcs in a certain direction, it stores and provides the 1D analytical solution (a(x), b(y) and c(z) in the previous paragraph) and their second derivatives. 

  2. The `ConvergenceTest` is the main class of those tests. It inherits from the `testing::TestWithParam<int>` class of the Google library and implements all the function needed to perform a convergence test: the creation of the domain and of the solver, the computation of the RHS (based on an `AnalyticalField`), the solve itself, the computation of the error and of the convergence order. The templated parameters are: the location of the data (cell-centred (test number 0 to 5999) or node-centred (test number 6000 to 11 999), a specific kernel and the combination of the boundary conditions. The `ConvergenceTest` performs the tests using 6 different kernels. If one of the kernel does not have the right convergence order, the test fails. 


## Compilation 
Those tests depends on the Google test library. You should install it using :
```shell
 git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
 cd /googletest
 git checkout v1.12.x # C++-11 is not supported in v1.13.x or later
 cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/soft/googletest
 make install -j
 rm -rf /googletest
 ```
Then, you should add the location of the library in your ARCH_FILE:
```shell 
## Specify the location of Googletest library (by default, assumed to be /usr/lib/)
GTEST_INC := /soft/googletest/include
GTEST_LIB := /soft/googletest/lib
```

Afterwards, you have to compile the flups library. 
Finally, you can compile the test using 
```shell
make destroy; 
make -j
```


You can launch the test using 
```shell
mpirun -n 8 ./flups_test_a2a 
```

You can select a certain test using 
```shell 
mpirun -n 8 ./flups_test_a2a --gtest_filter=FlupsValidation/ConvergenceTest.AllBoundaryConditions/0-11999
```

All the tests can be listed using 
```shell 
./flups_test_a2a --gtest_list_tests
```
